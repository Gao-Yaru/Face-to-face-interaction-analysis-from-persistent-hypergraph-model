# Interaction-Persistent-Hypergraph
we provide an algorithm of computing barcodes for hypergraphs from a given filtration. This algorithm is inspired by the one for simplicial complex introduced by Carlsson. 

<h3> Description </h3>

This repository was created for Matlab scripts used in the manuscript Face-to-face interaction analysis from persistent hypergraph model.

<h3> Matlab scripts </h3>

The scripts used to introduce the process with analyzing the face-to-face interactions datasets of different populations are:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
test.m

</ul>

We further include the script

<ul>

<p>
<li>

hypergraph.m
  
</ul>



<h3> Datasets </h3>

The dataset was introduced by socioPatterns sensing program. 
  
<h3> External software necessary to run the scripts </h3>

We include all functions, other sources of software and directories used by the scripts.

<ul>

<p>
<li>
plot_barcodes.m: We use this Matlab function written by Nina Otter. It is available at her <a href="https://github.com/n-otter/PH-roadmap"> repository</a>. We retrieved it in 2023.

</ul>
